# SiamenseNet for MNIST Dataset
Learning the Siamese Net with MNIST and Tensorflow 2.3 and Python 3.8

Creating this network to learn about the basic siamese net.

The requirement for running the code
```
pip install tensorflow-gpu==2.3.1
```

If you do not have the dedicated GPU to run the code:
```
pip install tensorflow==2.3.1
```

Some libraries that need to be included:
```
pip install idx2numpy
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
```

### How to run the code
To execute the code, you may enter the following command:
```
python 
```

### Design and Explaination
This is based of a simple design of CNN network. 


### Other works that can be referred
I have tried some of the other works but only some of them works due to different environment requiremnet. 
So I highly suggesting you guys using Anaconda/Enthought to create a testing environment for testing out the code.
